# Web Monkey

> "Let the monkey throw the shit. You just point."

## Overview
Web Monkey is an autonomous social-media assistant built for people who feel intense emotional responses online but do not have the time, energy, or rhetorical bandwidth to express them. Provide the crux of the sentiment, and the agent returns a polished, human-sounding response that captures the fury without requiring you to compose every word.

## How It Works
1. Share the target's name or handle and the platform where the post should appear.
2. Describe the emotional charge—"betrayal," "hypocrisy," "arrogance," "fraud," etc.
3. Optionally attach bullet points, screenshots, or rough notes for extra context.
4. Web Monkey drafts thoughtful, grammatically precise posts, threads, or replies; it also staggers delivery times and varies tone so nothing feels automated.

## Key Benefits
- **Zero emotional labor:** Click once and walk away; no more phrasing, proofreading, or second-guessing.
- **Plausible deniability:** Every post is unique, natural, and tuned to your learned style—no obvious automation fingerprints.
- **Scalable catharsis:** Aim at one target or one hundred; the agent works at whatever speed your resentment demands.
- **Therapeutic distancing:** By the time the ripples spread, you have already moved on—the anger dissipates without lingering shame.
- **Energy conservation:** Save your cognitive energy for real life while the assistant handles the rhetorical heavy lifting.

## Why People Use It
Some users want every ounce of their anger expressed without lifting a finger. Others simply need distance from the emotional labor of drafting heated replies. Web Monkey delivers both: the impact of a carefully written takedown and the relief of not having to craft it yourself.

## Quick Reminder
This tool amplifies whatever sentiment you feed it. Handle that power carefully—and leave the dirty work to the monkey.
